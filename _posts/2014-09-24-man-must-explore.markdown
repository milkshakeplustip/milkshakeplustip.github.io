subtitle:   "We are a young research team interested in human diversity and population genetics. We are applying genomic and computational tools to answer research questions about human evolution with particular interest in populations from the Americas and the Pacific. The scope of our projects range from population structure, demographic inference, selection and adaptive evolution, to functional and biomedical implications of human genetic variation. We are also applying similar population genetic approaches to other species relevant to Mexican and Latinamerican biodiversity."
