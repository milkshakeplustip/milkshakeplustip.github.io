<h2>Andrés Moreno Estrada</h2><b><i>Principal Investigator</i></b> | <i>andres.moreno@cinvestav.mx</i> | <a href=https://twitter.com/morestrada>Twitter</a> | <a href=https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=e8sFFesAAAAJ&hl=en>Scholar</a><p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/moreno_2_300.jpg" alt="Andres" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 0 0"> I am a medical doctor and population geneticist deeply interested in molecular evolution and its implications in human population history and medical genomics. During my PhD I was trained in evolutionary and population genetics, which complemented my previous medical background. As a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Carlos Bustamante and research associate at Stanford University, my work integrated genomics, evolution and precision medicine in many different projects involving large collections of populations, in particular from the Americas and the Pacific. Our group is interested in human evolution, adaptation, and population history as well as the biomedical implications of human genetic diversity in underserved populations of the world.

<h2>Karla Sandoval</h2><b><i>Postdoctoral Fellow</i></b> | <i>karla.sandoval@cinvestav.mx</i><p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/Karla250.jpg" alt="Karla" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> I am a physical anthropologist interested in cultural, linguistic and genetic diversity of indigenous populations, particularly from Mexico and Latin America. My PhD in population genetics allowed me to build a multidisciplinary background to interact with archaeologists, anthropologists, biologists and geneticists. I enjoy doing fieldwork and connecting participant communities with genetic research under a respectful framework. During my first postdoc at Stanford University I had the opportunity to launch international projects in rural communities across Mexico, Peru, and Chile. My current work at LANGEBIO combines ethnography, paleogenomics, and population genetics on ancient samples from archaeological sites and modern populations across Mexico.

<h2>Consuelo Quinto</h2><b><i>Postdoctoral Fellow</i></b> | <i>consuelo.quinto@cinvestav.mx</i><p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/consuelo_2.jpg" alt="Consuelo" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> I am a graduate of the Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and obtained my PhD degree from the Graduate Interdisciplinary Program in Genetics at the University of Arizona. The focus of my dissertation was the use of SNP array data to infer the demographic history of human admixed populations. I am involved in different projects at the Moreno Lab including the demographic study of Near and Remote Oceania and the ancestry service at LANGEBIO. My interests are human evolution, population and forensic genetics. I love Star Wars.

<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/alex_recorte.jpg" alt="Alex" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> Alex once drove all the way from Guanajuato to Stanford University, where he is a PhD student at the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME). He is an integral part of the Moreno Lab, advising in the application and development of ancestry-specific methods for the deconvolution of complex demographic patterns.

<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/patricio.jpg" alt="Pat" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> I am a PhD candidate in Biological Sciences with mention in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Chile. I am interested in human population genetics and evolutionary biology, and my research area focuses on the search of evidence of biological adaptations in maritime hunter-gatherer populations from Patagonia.

<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/Pavel250.jpg" alt="Pavel" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> My current master's degree project focuses on tracing the place of the genetic origin of enigmatic ancient human remains through the use of ancient DNA data and population genomics bioinformatic methods; and assessing possible ancient genetic relationships between distant cultural groups, especially from human populations currently underrepresented in databases.

<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/JuanEst250.jpg" alt="JuanEst" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> I am a graduate of the Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I am currently working on the dynamics of admixture in Mexico, specifically on the number, timing, and magnitude of migration waves from the three main ancestries in Latin America. Some approaches I am using are the algorithm <i>Tracts</i> and IBD analyses. I hope to associate these results with historic events. Moreover, I am exploring the Asian ancestry in Mexico, one of the migrations that has not been taken into account in population genetic analyses in the country.

<h2>Javier Blanco Portillo</h2><b><i>Masters Student</i></b> | <i>javier.blanco@cinvestav.mx</i> | <a href=https://mx.linkedin.com/in/javier-blanco-26112097>LinkedIn</a><p></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/Javier250.jpg" alt="Javier" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> Javier recently graduated from the Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Working under the supervision of Dr. Andrés Moreno, he spent the last year of the Program doing research on the population genetics of admixed human populations in the Americas and the Pacific. For his Master’s thesis at the Integrative Biology graduate program at LANGEBIO, he is now working on the genomic reconstruction of trans-Pacific human population dynamics. In addition to Anthropology, he is interested in Data Science and Systems Biology.

<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/Erika250.jpg" alt="Erika" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 0 0"> As a M.Sc. student, I am currently interested in studying the genetic diversity of human populations and the processes that modeled it. I am working on a project involving Native Mexicans and looking at multiculturalism under a genetic approach. We want to understand the genetic relationships between different Mexican ethnic groups combining historical, linguistic and cultural information. I love history and Mexican folklore and am always looking to know more about cultural expressions and languages in the world.
