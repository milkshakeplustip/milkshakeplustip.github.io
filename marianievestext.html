<p style="text-align:justify"> <img src="/img/nieves.jpg" alt="Snows" height="150" width="150" style="float:left; margin:0 20px 5px 0"> I am an anthropological geneticist interested in admixture and human population history. I received my PhD in Evolutionary Anthropology from the Arizona State University School of Human Evolution and Social Change. My dissertation research focused on characterizing the population history of the Caribbean using ancient DNA and modern genomics approaches. I am currently a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow jointly supervised by Dr. Andrés Moreno Estrada and Dr. Anne C. Stone (ASU). My work at the Moreno Lab focuses on understanding genetic structure, admixture and adaptation in Peruvian populations. I am originally from Puerto Rico.
